    <description>This case analysis is centered around the organizational structure of the Appex corporation. Appex was a fast-paced, rapidly expanding company in the late 80's/early 90's. Focused on cellular technology, the company quickly ran into trouble with managing its ever expanding group of employees, getting projects out on time, and providing good customer service. Organizational structure is derived from organizational strategy and plays a role in determining IT architecture, the jobs created to support the architecture, and the people hired to filled the jobs.</description>
