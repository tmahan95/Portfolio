    <description>This is a case analysis of Burlington Northern, a railroad company. In the case the company is considering implementing the ARES system, which would require an investment of several hundred million dollars. In the case I analyze the costs and benefits associated with such a system, and conclude with a recommendation based on the evidence within the case.</description>

    <description>This case analysis is centered around the organizational structure of the Appex corporation. Appex was a fast-paced, rapidly expanding company in the late 80's/early 90's. Focused on cellular technology, the company quickly ran into trouble with managing its ever expanding group of employees, getting projects out on time, and providing good customer service. Organizational structure is derived from organizational strategy and plays a role in determining IT architecture, the jobs created to support the architecture, and the people hired to filled the jobs.</description>

    <description>Connor Metal is a manufacturer of custom machined parts as well as some commodity parts. Over the last couple of years the company has gone through major restructuring, moving from a functional structure to divisional, with high emphasis on divisional autonomy. Two highly effective systems have been developed in two different divisions. One is Connor Software, the other Job Boss. This analysis focuses on how to push the newer and seemingly more effective Connor Software out to the three remaining divisions without violating divisional autonomy Bob Sloss, the CEO, has spent great time and effort to successfully implement.</description>

    <description>This is a basic package shipping and tracking application. The only type of package this application tracks is a ground package. In later programs, other kinds of packages will be created, shipped and tracked. This program uses a six parameter constructor to create ground packages, these consist of the origin zip code, destination zip code, length, width, height and weight in pounds.</description>

    <description>This program explores the creation of a simple class hierarchy including (limited) use of polymorphism. Building on the instructors advanced program 0, I was tasked with creating classes derived from the abstract parcel base class. From these classes I derive other concrete classes to create and calculate the cost of shipping of various types of packages.</description>

    <description>This program generates a list of objects and puts them in an array. LINQ queries are then used to sort the parcel objects in the array by destination zip code, order cost, and parcel type. Finally, all airpackage objects are selected that are considered heavy, and ordered by weight.</description>
